Bugs:

The enqueue() function possesses improper behavior. 
Rather than adding new elements to the back of the list, it adds them to the front. 
In this way, the queue actually behaves more like a stack.

For example, in test 11, after enqueueing 8 elements we end up with: 
HEAD = 7 -> 6 -> 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0 = TAIL
And after dequeueing 4 elements we get:
HEAD = 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0 = TAIL
